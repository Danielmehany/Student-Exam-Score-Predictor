# Student-Exam-Score-Predictor
leveraged Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to process a dataset containing over 30,000 student records with 13 variables. Developed three linear regression models to predict math, writing, and reading scores based on various student attributes. The models achieved an average error of 5.6%, with 8.8% of scores predicted with perfect accuracy.
