# Student-Exam-Score-Predictor
This project leverages **Pandas** and **Jupyter Notebook** to analyze and process a dataset containing **30,000+ student records** with **13 variables**. The primary objective was to develop predictive models for student performance in **math, writing, and reading** scores using **linear regression**.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and structured the dataset for efficient analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identified and selected key student attributes for model training.
- **Model Development**: Implemented **three linear regression models** to predict scores.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Achieved an average error of **5.6%**.
  - **8.8%** of the predicted scores were **perfectly accurate**.

Below is a graphical representation of the model performance:
